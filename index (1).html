<p>Labrador Retrievers are highly affectionate, outgoing, cute, friendly, and energetic dogs. Their easygoing personality makes them a solid choice for families and therapy. 

Labradors need a lot of exercise, and love playing fetch and swimming. Labs are also strong contenders for dog sports, showing particular skills in obedience, agility, tracking, and dock-diving.

They also make for great work dogs, demonstrating their abilities through hunting, search-and-rescue, drug and bomb detection, or working as service dogs.</p>
<p>Labrador Retrievers are known for both their kind eyes and seemingly non-stop wagging ‘otter tail.’ These labs come in in different colors. Some of those comes in yellow, black, and chocolate.

<p>Depending on the gender, Labrador Retrievers are typically 21.5-24.5 inches tall and weigh between 55–80 pounds. They have a life expectancy of 11–13 years.</p>

Labs shed quite a bit. Regular brushing and occasional baths will help maintain their thick coat. Prospective dog owners should be ready to regularly trim their pet’s nails and clean their teeth often.</p>
	
<p> These dogs are America's favorite breed. They really love water and they are incredibly smart. They can become destructive due to their high energy. These dogs are friendly and outgoing, devoted to their families, eager to please and easygoing, and energetic most of the time. </p>

<p>Lab mixes are one of the most popular mixed breeds available from shelters and rescues. Labrador Retriever mixes can share common traits with any number of other breeds, but resemble Labs in physical characteristics and personality traits.</p>


<p>While most shelters and rescues cannot determine a dog's exact breed, some facilities heavily uses DNA tests to determine the genetics of a mixed breed dog, and AKC registered Labs may be put into a shelter.</p>


<p>Some of the most common Labrador Retriever mixes may include Golden Retriever, German Shepherd, Border Collie, Corgi, Poodle, and American Staffordshire Terrier, which is also called the pit bull.</p>

<p>Yellow Labradors are my favorite types of dog breeds. These are dogs that are energenic, friendly, and supportive for their owners most of the time. These are dogs that are highly recommened for familaies and those who want to have a nice companion with them.</p>
